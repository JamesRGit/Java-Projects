# Java Project Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a collection of some projects I've built to demonstrate my skills in Java and software engineering principles.
Each project is contained within its own folder and is built using Maven.

Projects:
- [**Snake Game:**](https://github.com/JamesRGit/Java-Projects/tree/main/SnakeGame) A classic implementation of the Snake game built entirely with Java Swing.
- [**Library Management System:**](https://github.com/JamesRGit/Java-Projects/tree/main/LibraryManagementSystem) This is a simple, console-based Library Management System
